# CSC356-Final

I would say I am about halfway done with this final. I need to add the coach page and a little introduction about the game, and I should be done with that part. For the players, I might make that code JSON instead of what I have right now. But things have been going pretty good for me this final. Oh, I guess I will also add a couple more players and more variety in their salary because I saw that, in my opinion, I have too many players' salaries in the 20 million.Â
